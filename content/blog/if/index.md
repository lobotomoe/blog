When someone talk about global problems and how to solve them, I often hear - "if we all", "if everyone", "if each of us...", if...

But I have never heard how it is proposed to implement this "if". How is it proposed to make it so that "we are all" and that "everyone".

My life experience says that "we all" and "everyone" work well without any innovations in small groups â€” our family, friends, acquaintances. In general, if there is a desire, we can agree to do something together. Because we know each other and we have some level of trust, we are not nobody to each other.

But for a real solution to global problems, the effect of the agreement of one family or one group of people **is not enough**. We need hundreds and thousands of people who will participate in such an agreement.

But how can this be achieved? We are not nodes of the blockchain network. We are not software on which you can write a consensus and which will simply execute a given program.

- How to understand that the other will fulfill the terms of the agreement?
- How to understand what will be done in full and exactly when it will be needed?
- Why do we even need to understand this?
- How to negotiate?
- How to involve people?
- Where to start?
