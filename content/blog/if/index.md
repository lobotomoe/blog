When someone talk about global problems and how to solve them, I often hear - "if we all", "if everyone", "if each of us...", if...

But I have never heard how it is proposed to implement this "if". How is it proposed to make it so that "we are all" and that "everyone".

My life experience says that "we all" and "everyone" work well without any innovations in small groups — our family, friends, acquaintances. In general, if there is a desire, we can agree to do something together. Because we know each other and we have some level of trust, we are not nobody to each other.

## Problem comes here

**Man is weak alone.** It is obviously. For a real solution to global problems, the effort of the one family or one group of people **is not enough**. We need hundreds and thousands of people.

But **coordinating is difficult.** Especially the cordination of large groups. For many reasons.

> VISITOR: Even in my world, Simplicio, coordination isn’t as simple as everyone jumping simultaneously every time one person shouts “Jump!” For coordinated action to be successful, you need to trust the institution that says what the action should be, and a majority of people have to trust that institution, and they have to know that other people trust the institution, so that everyone expects the coordinated action to occur at the critical time, so that it makes sense for them to act too.

You have the key concept, but you use it mainly for making video games?

## Attempt 1. We need to start somewhere.

![Organize!](organize.jpg)

So let's just take the mentioned coordination requirements (look real, yeah?) and try to think about how to implement this from scratch (is in possiblt at all?)

1. Need to have institution that says what the action should be
2. Majority of people trust that institution
3. They know that other people trust the institution
4. Everyone expects the coordinated action to occur at the critical time

Finding institutions that want you to do something (like fund them, haha) is easy. There is no problem here. ✅

Assume that we live in a country with 100M population. Majority of people in this case is 50M+ of people.
Okaaaay, Google. How to create institution known (mind you, not even talking about trust) by 50M+ of people? ❌

P.S. Actually answer is known. See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most-followed_Twitter_accounts) and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most-subscribed_YouTube_channels) 😄

## Attempt 2. Groups with target number of participants.

We can't build institution known by majority of people of whole country. At least we can't build it alone (cooperation problem even here!) and in short time.
It is not our way and we need to think towards to more realistic conditions. Majority of people is not always majority of people of whole country of course.

Each coordination has particular purpose. We come together to achieve something. I think in most cases we no need to majority of people to achieve our goal. Just need particular number of cooperation participant.

I can imagine world where someone can create "initiative" — define goal, description, target number participants and publish it somewhere.
And it already really works — people create "events" on social networks and gather other people.

What happens? It turns out there is no problem actually? 🤔

Not so fast. If you consider that "events" closer you will see that mostly this "events" is "safe".
"Safe" is when participating in event have near zero risk (life, health, finance, legal).

What about unsafe and dangerous events?
In most cases, attempts to solve really important problems cause conflict with the authorities, corporations, police or criminals.
We need to continue our attempts and find solution for unsafe initiatives / events / actions. ❌

## Attempt 3. How to deal with unsafe?

The preambule of [Universal declaration of human rights](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights) says:

> Whereas it is essential, if man is not to be compelled to have recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression, that human rights should be protected by the rule of law...

Unsafe actions is not a problem for a desperate people. For angry and tired people. For people that lost everything.

It is reason why we do not consider how to deal with unsafe in that way. We assume more typical situation when you have something that you don't want to loose — family, health, money, reputation, etc.

We still can take some risk, but is much more complicated to evaluate whether it is worth the risk.
My life experience says that for involve really big number of people in something risky we need to reduce risk to near-zero level.
Inpossible? Yeah, looks like. But this is reality.

Let's try to guess how we can do this.

Coming soon...
